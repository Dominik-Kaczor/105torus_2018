Description:

Drawing circles, cylinders and cones is a good start for an image synthesis software, but one have to admitit is not fully satisfying. . . This project is the continuation of the previous one, and should allow you to drawmore complex forms, such as a torus, which do not emerge from 2nd degree equations, but from superiordegree equations (4th degree in the torus case).

The objective of this project is to solve a 4th degree equation:a4x4+a3x3+a2x2+a1x1+a0= 0. A directresolution method does exist (Ferrari’s method), but does not generalize. Thus, we will rather compare 3iterative algorithms:

•The bisection method,

•Newton’s method,

•The secant method.
